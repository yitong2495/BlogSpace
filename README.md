# BlogSpace-APIs
 Small project to practice API


This is a small project to practice API.

Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To generate fake blog entries, this blog app makes use of the JSON placeholder API. 

I've included a form where users can write a new blog post with a title and body that will appear above previous posts.
